Cat Facts
=========
This was a quick two-day project from Week 6 of Dev Bootcamp. For this assignment, we got to work on anything. An app of our own creation. I wanted more experience working with 3rd party APIs, so I chose to get an app running with the Twilio API, which (among other things) can send messages to / receive messages from any phone. This was the second time I had worked with an API (the first one being Twitter), and the first time I pushed an app to heroku. Unfortunately, I haven't upgraded to a full Twilio account, so you can't see it work, but if you see me, ask me to show you.

So anyway, this app is an automated version of Cat Facts. (See here for backstory: http://www.buzzfeed.com/mattcherette/masterful-cat-facts-texting-prank). If you text the Cat Facts number, it will send you a fun fact about cats. Next step would be to add cron jobs to send daily/hourly facts to subscribed users.
